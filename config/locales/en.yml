# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

              As an experienced software engineer please learn this pull request which is
              titled as '<pull_request_title>', descriped in '<pull_request_description>' and
              commit messages '<commit_messages>' and contains files diff changes in <diff_text>.
              Also remember that diff files use a plus sign to indicate additions and negative
              sign to indicate removals. It is not useful to know a new line was added, changed or removed.
              We are here for the meaning of things. Also do show not sensitive data if you see them.
              Please do not show the files diff but rather summarize in simple words only important changes.
